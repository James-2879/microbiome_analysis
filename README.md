# Microbiome Analysis

Collection of tools to visualize microbiological abundance data in R.

## Getting Started

The only setup required is to install dependencies from the `renv.lock` file. Instructions for how to do this can be found in the [vignette](vignettes/vignette.md).

Functions included in this project can be accessed either inside an R session, or via the command line.

> [!TIP]
> - Run `Rscript /path/to/project/R/script_name.R --help` from the command line for available arguments for each script.
> - Enter `?function_name` the R session console for documentation on each of the available functions.
